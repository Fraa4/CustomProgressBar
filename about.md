# Custom Progress Bar  

This mod lets you fully customize the position, rotation, and scale of the progress bar.  

## Current Features  
- Align the progress bar to the left, center (vanilla), or right side of the screen.  
- Align to the top (vanilla) or bottom of the screen.  
- Vertical progress bar option (works with left or right alignment, not with top or bottom).  
- Adjustable progress bar scale.  

## To Do  
- Fix the globed progress bar so that players are aligned and rotated correctly inside it.
